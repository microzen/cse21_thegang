{\sc Instructions}\newline

This homework should be done in {\bf groups} of one to four students, without assistance from anyone besides the instructional staff and your group members.  Homework must be submitted through Gradescope by a {\bf single representative} of your group and received by {\bf 11:59pm} on the due date.\\
 

Students should consult their textbook, class notes, lecture slides, podcasts, group members, instructors, TAs, and tutors when 
they need help with homework. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours, but questions on Piazza should be private, visible only to instructors. 

This assignment will be graded for not only the \emph{correctness} of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas clearly and logically. You should explain or justify, present clearly how you arrived at your conclusions and justify the correctness of your answers with mathematically sound reasoning (unless explicitly told not to). Whether you use formal proof techniques or write a more informal argument for why something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your goal should be to {\bf convince the reader} that your results and methods are sound.
